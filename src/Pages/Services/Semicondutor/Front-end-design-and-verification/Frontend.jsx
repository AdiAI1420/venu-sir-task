                Interestingly, the success of an advanced IC design greatly
                relies on the ease with which it traverses the front-end designs
                and the related verifications. Much happily, the highly
                accomplished team of proficient engineers at soc circuits specializes
                in delivering multiple projects in front-end RTL Designs and SoC
                integrations of multi-million gates IPs, FPGA & system
                architecture design, and ASIC & IP prototyping with FPGA. The
                team possesses hands-on experience across Automotive, Graphics,
                Server, Modem, 5G domains.
